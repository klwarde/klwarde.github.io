Hi, I'm Kathy Warde, a Technical Writer from Australia. 

I specialise in creating precise, user-focused documentation that bridges the gap between technical concepts and real-world users. I’ve collaborated with diverse teams to produce everything from user guides and operational documents to business requirement specifications—all delivered with a meticulous eye for detail.

What sets me apart? My ability to chip away at a task, and transform intricate details into content that informs, empowers, and delights.

Beyond documentation, I’m a lifelong learner who enjoys delving into new technologies, exploring creative projects, and finding innovative ways to communicate. I hope this portfolio showcases not just what I do, but the passion and curiosity that fuel my work.
